## Simple Dart Calculator

This coded uses  the `dart:io` library to create a command-line interface (CLI) calculator. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition.

```dart
import 'dart:io'

void main(){
    //This is how to read  input from the user in dart and convert it to integer.
    int input1 = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
}
```
